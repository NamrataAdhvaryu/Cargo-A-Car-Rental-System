# Cargo-A-Car-Rental-System
A	new	up	and	coming	car	rental	service	is	wishing	to	have	a	user	interface	that	will	allow	their	customers	to	view	the	models,	descriptions	and	prices	of	different	cars available.	The	user	has	the	ability	to	register	and	log	in	to	the	App	and	track	their	rental	plan.	The	App	will	be	responsive,	allowing	for	the	customer	to	view	it	on	any	device,	from	tablets	to	mobile	phones.	The	administrator	will	also	be able	to	login	through	the	same	form	but	have	the	ability	to	add/remove	new	car	rentals,	change	prices,	and	so	on.

# Goals	for	the	Project
This	software,	called	'CARGO-THE CAR RENTAL SYSTEM', will	allow	for	the	company	to	access	their	database	securely	and	safely	in	a	user-friendly	online	environment.	Allowing	for	them	to	change	car	information	with	ease.	The	software	will	be	in	sync	with	the	both	the App,	allowing	for	real-time	up-to-date services	for	their	customers.


# Process Flow	Preview
For	our	process	flow,	we	plan	on	taking	the	iterative	route,	as	we	find	communication	essential	throughout	the	development	process.	In	order	to	plan	all	aspects	of	the	project	in	detail,	we	feel	that	contacting	the	car	rental	service	and having	those	in	charge	be	in	the	same	room	when	
the	planning	is	taking	place.	It	is	our	way	of	discussing	requirements	and	develop	important	notes	that	will	help	in	constructing	the	overall	feeland	idea.	The	modeling	process	in	its	own	right	we	feel	is	not	a	start	to	finish	process.	There	will	be	times	that	we	may	have	to	go	back	to certain	portions	within	the	modeling	activity	to	ensure	a	sufficient	model.	We	wish	to	make	sure	that	if	we	miss	anything,	we	do	not	figure	that	out	in	the	construction	stage.


#	Task	Descriptions
Stakeholder	Meetings:
The	stakeholders	and	the	software	engineering	team	conducts	meetings	in	order	to get	the	full	grasp	of	the	problem	at	hand,	obtaining	any	and	all	information	needed.	Conflicts	and	negotiations	would	be	conducted	during	this	time	and	any	time	throughout	the	project	process	flow.
Design	Models	and	Mockups:
Designing	the	models	and	mockups	help	to	ensure	clarity	in	view	of	the	project	as	well	as	how	it	works.	Stakeholders	are	to	sit	through	this	process	as	drawings	are	created.

Database	Creation:
A	database	is	created	using	the	models	to	provide	storage	for	customer	information,	vehicle	information,	and	payment	reports.	Testing	of	the	database	is	ensured	at	this	point.

Employee	Software	Creation:
The	software	that	is	to	be	used	by	the	employees	will	be	designed	using	Visual	Basic	using	the	guide	of	the	mockups,	requirements,	and	models.	The	software	will	act	as	a	simple	and	easy	to	understand	user	interface	to	‘browse’	and	among	other	functions	the	database	- the	
information	stored	including	customer	information,	vehicle	information,	and	payment	reports.

Application	Creation:
The web	site	will	be	designed	using	Xcode	on	Swift	programming	language	using	the	guide	of	the	mockups,	requirements,	and	models.	The	website	will	be	implemented	using	high-quality	design	techniques.	It	should	allow	for	users	to	immediately	see	the	rental	cars	that	are	available.	They	can	also	have	the	ability	to	search	for	a	certain	vehicle	they	desire.	Once	they	select	they	can	register	or	log	in	to	store	any	private	information	they	area About	to	give	to	the	company	in	order	to	obtain	their	vehicle,	although	registering	is	not	required.

Testing:
Testing	will	be	implemented	on	both	the	website	and	software.	Test	cases	may	be	used	to	guide	and	understand	the	basic	actions	of	both	customers	and	employees.	Any	bugs	or	errors	that	occur	will	be	identified	and	resolved.	

Finalization	and	Reports:
All	testing	and	function	processes	are	finalized	at	this	stage.	Reports	will	be	created	to	ensure	
all	information	and	functionality	is	clear	in	order	to	make	the	user	manual	and	to	help	ensure	
employees	can	use	the	software	with	ease.
